v1.1.0 Nov 7, 2009
* Bumped to version 1.1.0 to avoid confusion with an existing hbase-ruby on gemcutter that was at version 1.0
* Reimplemented entirely with HBase Stargate (old REST API was obsoleted by this)
* Since Stargate can return JSON, parsing is now done with JSON instead of XML
* API change to open_scanner. Now expects open_scanner(table_name, options) with available options listed under HBase::Model::Scanner.AVAILABLE_OPTS 

v0.4 Oct 12, 2008
* support 'scanner'

v0.1 Jul 29, 2008
